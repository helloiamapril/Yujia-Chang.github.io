    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concepts of Python Data Structures. By the end, I was familiar with core data types such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets; understood how to manipulate and traverse these data structures efficiently; implemented algorithms to solve real-world problems using Python; identified the appropriate data structure to optimize performance for specific tasks; and applied these skills to build structured and efficient Python applications.

    summary: |
     I studied the core concepts of Python for Data Science, gaining proficiency in libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. By the end, I was able to manipulate and analyze large datasets effectively, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, visualize data trends, and generate insights. Additionally, I developed a solid understanding of statistical analysis and machine learning workflows using scikit-learn. These skills were applied to real-world scenarios, enabling me to extract meaningful information from complex data and present it in a clear, actionable format.
